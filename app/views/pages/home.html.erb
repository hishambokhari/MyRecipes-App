      <h2>Lemon drizzle cake...</h2>
      <p>
      Deliciously light, fluffy and moist sponge. Highly recommended. Mine took 35 mins so keep an eye on it! Also tried this out without any lemon but added a teaspoon of vanilla essence instead. Made a lovely vanilla loaf with butter icing on top. Secret is not to mix all 5 ingredients together at once but to cream sugar and butter first, then add eggs and whisk in well, then fold in flour. Add milk right at end. YUMMY!  </p>

      <h2>Beef Stew review...</h2>
      <p>This was delicious. I cubed a chuck roast which was cheap and flavorful (removing all excess fat). I added some worchestershire sauce and ketchup at the end to add umami (flavor). After cooking I separated the solids and boiled the liquid a bit to reduce and concentrate, then whisked in a slurry of flour and water to thicken before recombining with meat and veggies.  </p>

      <h2>Classic Goulash...</h2>
      <p>Classic Goulash is one of my favorite old fashioned recipes, made with ground beef, onion, bell pepper, and macaroni in a seasoned tomato sauce with diced tomatoes. Itâ€™s perfect for busy weeknight dinners because all it takes is one pot and less than 45 minutes!</p>
